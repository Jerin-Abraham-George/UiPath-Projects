# ü§ñ UiPath-Projects  
This repository presents a structured collection of automation workflows developed using UiPath Studio. It serves as a personal learning portfolio, documenting my progress in understanding and applying robotic process automation (RPA) principles.

Each project reflects practical experimentation with core UiPath capabilities, including user input handling, API integration, conditional logic, and data extraction. While I am in the early stages of mastering UiPath, the workflows are thoughtfully constructed and professionally documented to ensure clarity, scalability, and continuous improvement.

## üìö Purpose  
- To consolidate all UiPath projects in a centralized and organized repository  
- To demonstrate hands-on exploration of automation concepts  
- To track growth and proficiency in UiPath Studio over time  
- To share reusable workflows and documentation with the broader community

## üìÅ Contents  
- Individual project folders with `.xaml` files and supporting assets  
- Markdown-based documentation for each workflow  
- Screenshots and sample outputs for visual reference
