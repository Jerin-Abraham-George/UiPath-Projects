# 🧥 Clothing Consultant

## 📌 Overview
The Clothing Consultant is a lightweight UiPath automation designed to classify weather conditions based on real-time temperature data. It prompts the user for a city name, fetches current weather via the OpenWeatherMap API, and returns a simple clothing recommendation: Too Hot, Too Cold, or Moderate.
This automation helps users make quick clothing decisions by evaluating temperature thresholds and displaying a clear message based on live weather data.
